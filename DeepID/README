Requirement is the "Youtube Faces Aligned Dataset" [aligned_images_DB] downloadable from https://www.cs.tau.ac.il/~wolf/ytfaces/index.html#download

1) run "crop.py"
2) run "split*.py"
3) run "vec.py"
4) run "deepid1.py" for training
5) run "predict*.py"

INPUT-INSTANCE ATTACK
run "create_input_instances.py" to create the poison samples and backdoor samples after the "crop" and before the "split"

NOTE that if you want to avoid the training..we provided for every attack the "checkpoint" folder, poison and backdoor folders and the *.csv files. The "checkpoint" folder contains the checkpoints of the model for predictions and we can run directly the "predict*.py" file.
